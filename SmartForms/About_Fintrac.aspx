            <p>
                Love them or hate them we believe that CREA's Web Forms&copy; are here to stay in Canadian Real Estate! 
            </p>
             <p>
                CREA has 'negotiated' a framework for compliance for Real Estate and published that compliance in a series of Web Forms.
            </p>
            <p>
                In effect, CREA has said 'if you fill out these Web Forms and file them properly you WILL be Fintrac Compliant!'
            </p>
            <p>We believe we distinguish ourselves from our competitors by building a 'type once' bridge between Web Forms and Smart Forms.</p>

            <p>
                New rules and processes around Fintrac make it more than a Smart Form but a full DMS (Document Managment System) that brokerages and agents are required to maintain. </p>

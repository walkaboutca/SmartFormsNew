        <h2>Saving your Web Form <small>©</small></h2>
        <p>In order to import and use the data from a Web Form it needs to be saved in an &#39;Editable&#39; PDF.</p>
        <p>This is a good habit to get into for any agent becuase it saves a working copy of the PDF on your local drive (or cloud drive if that&#39;s how you are setup).</p>
        <p>To to do this:</p>
        <p>1 - Go to your Web Forms Member Dashbaord. Note below we have a test Transaction or Kit labled &#39;Lookout Transactions Forms&#39; with several Forms. We will select or click for &#39;Edit&#39; the &#39;Multiple Listing Contract MLC&#39;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2 - The selected form should open in a new window. NOTE in the [File] menu (top left) there is a [Save] option. Clicking on that option will bring up further options. Select the [Save as Editiable PDF] button.</p>
        <p>3 - Clicking the [Save as Editiable PDF] button will automatically (in most modern browsers) download and save the selected FZorm to your default &#39;Download&#39; folder.</p>

        <br />
        <br />
        4 - The location of the &#39;Download&#39; folder can be different depending on browser or O/S but note where this folder is for future use ... FAAS will make use of it extensively.<br />
